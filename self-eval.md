# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
 * *I didn't feel as confident combining iterations with syntaxes. Bryce was on the same assignment so we jumped into a study hall together and worked through it on repl.it. It was good to warm up before the pairing.*

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful?
 * *I feel I'm writing everything down. Going back and re-reading webpages just begins to look like black print on a white background and hard to recall which of those I read whatever info I got. I posted what I've realized is helpful which is writing in all caps because I can write the code portions in lowercase.*
 When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  *I'm finding just referencing back to my notes where I have samples of code written helps me most.*

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
 * *I like to try to solve it because I feel it's better committed to memory if you figure it out. Google after that but try Googling the smaller bits and understanding them before Googling the answer.*
